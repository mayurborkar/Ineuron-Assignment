    "**Solution:-** Most data can be categorized into 4 basic types from a Machine Learning perspective: numerical data, categorical data, time-series data, and text.\n",
    " \n",
    "**1. Numerical Data:-** Numerical data represent values that can be measured and put into a logical order. Examples of numerical data are height, weight, age, number of movies watched, IQ, etc. To graph numerical data, one uses dot plots, stem and leaf graphs, histograms, box plots, ogive graphs, and scatter plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Categorical Data:-** Categorical data is a type of data that can be stored into groups or categories with the aid of names or labels. This grouping is usually made according to the data characteristics and similarities of these characteristics through a method known as matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Time-Series Data:-** Time series data is data that is collected at different points in time. This is opposed to cross-sectional data which observes individuals, companies, etc. at a single point in time. Because data points in time series are collected at adjacent time periods there is potential for correlation between observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Text Data:-** Text data usually consists of documents which can represent words, sentences or even paragraphs of free flowing text. The inherent unstructured (no neatly formatted data columns!) and noisy nature of textual data makes it harder for machine learning methods to directly work on raw text data."

    "1. The Histogram:- \n",
    " * A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a bar graph, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Histograms are commonly used in statistics to demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occurs within a specific range. For example, a census focused on the demography of a country may use a histogram to show how many people are between the ages of 0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Histograms can be customized in several ways by the analyst. The first is to change the interval between buckets.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The other consideration is how to define the y-axis. The most basic label is to use the frequency of occurrences observed in the data, but one could also use percentage of total or density instead.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. The Scatter Plot:-\n",
    " * A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Scatter plots’ primary uses are to observe and show relationships between two numeric variables. The dots in a scatter plot not only report the values of individual data points, but also patterns when the data are taken as a whole.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Identification of correlational relationships are common with scatter plots. In these cases, we want to know, if we were given a particular horizontal value, what a good prediction would be for the vertical value. You will often see the variable on the horizontal axis denoted an independent variable, and the variable on the vertical axis the dependent variable."

    "**Solution:-** \n",
    "**1. Deleting the values:** You can delete the outliers if you know that the outliers are wrong or if the reason the outlier was created is never going to happen in the future. For example, there is a data set of peoples ages and the usual ages lie between 0 to 90 but there is data entry off the age 150 which is nearly impossible. So, we can safely drop the value that is 150.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Changing the values:** We can also change the values in the cases when we know the reason for the outliers. Consider the previous example for measurement or instrument errors where we had 10 voltmeters out of which one voltmeter was faulty. Here what we can do is that we can take another set of readings using a correct voltmeter and replace them with the readings that were taken by the faulty voltmeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data transformation:** Data transformation is useful when we are dealing with highly skewed data sets. By transforming the variables, we can eliminate the outliers for example taking the natural log of a value reduces the variation caused by the extreme values. This can also be done for data sets that do not have negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Using different analysis methods:** You could also use different statistical tests that are not as much impacted by the presence of outliers – for example using median to compare data sets as opposed to mean or use of equivalent nonparametric tests etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Valuing the outliers:** In case there is a valid reason for the outlier to exist and it is a part of our natural process, we should investigate the cause of the outlier as it can provide valuable clues that can help you better understand your process performance. Outliers may be hiding precious information that could be invaluable to improve your process performance. You need to take the time to understand the special causes that contributed to these outliers. Fixing these special causes can give you significant boost in your process performance and improve customer satisfaction. For example, normal delivery of orders takes 1-2 days, but a few orders took more than a month to complete. Understanding the reason why it took a month and fixing this process can help future customers as they would not be impacted by such large wait times."
